#Question 1 
#Probability of failure for A & B 
#FA <- Failure due to condition A 
#FB <- Failure due to condition B 
#FAB <- Falure due to conditions A & B 

#Probabilities for each failure condition
FA <- 0.02
FB <- 0.03
FAB <- 0.01

#Success defined as 1.00
PSuccess <- 1

#Queston 1.1 Probability of Failure = (FA + FB - FAB), we subtract FAB as we do not double count these 
#values in our equation
PFailure <- (FA+FB-FAB)

#Question 1.2
PSF <- PSuccess - PFailure 

#Numeric value for our equation above 
list(PSF)

#A randomly chosen chip has a 0.04 percent chance of failing. The alternative is that a 
#randomly chosen chip has a 96% chance of not failing. Knowing these statistics, the company 
#can corretctly price its warranty package correctly. 

#PRACTICE WORKING WITH STOCK MARKET DATA 

#Question 2.1 
#To begin our analysis, we will pull up the data for the stock 
#prices of Google through quantmod and referencing Yahoo.com's data. 

library("quantmod")
getSymbols('GOOG', src='yahoo')
head(GOOG)


#Question 2.2 
#Now, we will construct a new variable called daily returns, defined as difference in log. 
#Algebraically: return<-log(S[i]/S[i-1])

dailyreturns<-diff(GOOG$GOOG.Adjusted)/lag(GOOG$GOOG.Adjusted)

#Queston 2.3 
#Now to calculate the VaR (value at risk) for daily returns at 
#95 percent confidence level based on the distribution for the daily returns.

#the distribution of daily returns 
#ret is our variable we are examining
#0.05 is our alpha level in relation to our confidence interval of 95% 
#type = 1 refereces the inverse of empircal distribution function, y=0 if g=0, and 1 otherwise. Q[i](p) 
#is a discontinuous function of p, with m=0 when i=1 and i=2, and m=-1/2 when i=3
VaRdailyreturns.05<-quantile(dailyreturns, 0.05, type=1, na.rm=TRUE)

#Question 2.4 
#Set VaR for $10,000 invested at a 95% confidence interval
#VaR = Amount Invested * VaR for Daily Returns
VaR.05 <- 10000*VaRdailyreturns.05

#the below code gives us the amount that we could lose upon investing
list((VaR.05))

#the below code gives us the absolute value of the amount that we could lose upon investing
list(abs(VaR.05))

#Thus, there is a 5% chance that we will lose more than $259.6059 on our $10,000 investment in the next day. 

#Question 2.5 
#the distribution of daily returns 
#ret is our variable we are examining
#0.01 is our alpha level in relation to our confidence interval of 99%
#type = 1 refereces the inverse of empircal distribution function, y=0 if g=0, and 1 otherwise. Q[i](p) 
#is a discontinuous function of p, with m=0 when i=1 and i=2, and m=-1/2 when i=3
VaRdailyreturns.01<-quantile(dailyreturns, 0.01, type=1, na.rm=TRUE)


#VaR = Amount Invested * VaR for Daily Returns
VaR.01 <- 10000*VaRdailyreturns.01

#the below code gives us the amount that we could lose upon investing
list((VaR.01))

#the below code gives us the absolute value of the amount that we could lose upon investing
list(abs(VaR.01))

#Thus, there is a 1% chance that we will lose more than $518.9665 on our $10,000 investment in the next day. 

#Question 2.6 
#Upon our investigation we come across a stimulus, a change in CEO's, which effects the daily returns and 
#we would like to analyze the change on daily returns. We will focus on the data of Google's stock price 
#from yahoo post 2012.

#The below code specifies which year of data we want to stored in the variable GOOG2012
#We use >= to only include data past 2012-01-01
dailyreturns2<-subset(dailyreturns, index(dailyreturns)>="2012-01-01")
#using head(GOOG2012) we pull the most recent 6 values for Googles stock prices of 2012
head(dailyreturns2)


#Calulates the VaR for Daily Returns in for the opening day of the NYSE in 2012.
VaRdailyreturns2.05<-quantile(dailyreturns2, 0.05, type=1, na.rm=TRUE)
list(VaRdailyreturns2.05)

#VaR = Amount Invested * VaR for Daily Return, 2012
VaR2.05 <- 10000*VaRdailyreturns2.05

#Amount that one could lose upon investing in 2012 when alpha = 5%
list((VaR2.05))

#the below code gives us the absolute value of the amount that we could lose upon investing in 2012 at an alpha of 5%.
list(abs(VaR2.05))

#Thus, there is a 5% probability that we will lose more than $200.9413 off of our $10,000 investment 
#in the next after the CEO change at Google in 2012. 
list(VaR.05, VaR2.05)

#Additionally, the above code reveals the loss that we can expect at an alpha of 0.05 prior to the 
#CEO and post CEO switch. This shows that there is less variability in the stocks trading price and 
#that there is greater confidence in the earnings of the stock. Thus, in our preliminary analysis, 
#I conclude that the switch in CEO's was a good decision based on the assumption that no other stimuli 
#were present during this time which could be cause for the decrease in variablity. Thus, the CEO will 
#likely be held responsible for the company's success and be awarded a nice bonus. 

#Question 2.7
#We then want to calculate the VaR for the next week, thus we reset our variables. Since, 2012-01-01 and 2012-01-02 
#were observed US Holidays, we started our analysis on 12-01-03 a Tuesday. Therefore, when we look look a week out, 
#our observation, 12-01-10, will have be on a Tuesday as well.
GOOG.week<-weeklyReturn(GOOG$GOOG.Adjusted)
GOOGW12<-subset(GOOG.week, index(GOOG.week)>="2012-01-01")

#quantile of data pulled
weeklyReturn.05<-quantile(GOOGW12, 0.05, type=1, na.rm=TRUE)

#list results 
list(weeklyReturn.05)

#VaR = Amount Invested * VaR for Daily Return, 2012.
VaRW.05 <- 10000*weeklyReturn.05

#Amount that one could lose upon investing in 2012 at an alpha of 5%.
list((VaRW.05))

#Absolute value of the amount that one could lose upon investing in 2012 at an alpha of 5%.
list(abs(VaRW.05))

#Thus, there is a 5% chance that we will lose more than $442.31 on our $10,000 investment in the next week. 

#Question 3.1 
#EXPECTED VALUE FOR MARKET COMPETITORS
#Set variables for the case that n firms will join the market. Where Ci represents the number 
#of competitors for i competitors + 1. 
c(C1<-2, C2<-3, C3<-4, C4<-5, C5<-6)


#We'll express revenue in millions of dolalrs as a funciton of competitors in the 
#market: F(R)=100/Ci, for i firms in the market.
M<-100 

#Expected revenue given the number of firms in the market.
Revenue<-data.frame(M*(1/c(C1,C2,C3,C4,C5)))

#revenue is visualized through the list command 
list(Revenue)

#Set data frame to reference our probabilities for each additional competitor.
PP<-data.frame(c(P.C1<-0.1, P.C2<-0.25, P.C3<-0.3, P.C4<-0.25, P.C5<-0.1))

#Thus, we multiply our tables Revenue and PP togeher to generate our expected revenue at for each scenario. 
ExpectedValue<-sum(Revenue*PP)
list(ExpectedValue)

#Since our Expected Value is $27.5 Million and our fixed costs are $26 Million, I would recommend 
#that we enter the new market.

##Question 3.2 
#Suppose that you are averse to risk. Then calculate your expected utility using the following 
#utility function, where r is our risk-tolerance constat. 
r=50
U(x) = −exp(−x/r)

#Expected Utility 
EU <- (-exp(-ExpectedValue/r))
list(EU)
