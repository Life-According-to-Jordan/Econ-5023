# Question 1 

First of all, let me congratulate you on your invention. If I had to choose an ideal outcome for the dice it would be 6.5 as it would be the mean of the expected value for all outcomes from the dice. Thus, since the expected value for each dice is the same, the absolute value in the difference between roles would be zero. 

```{r}
#Variable for 2, 12-sided dice 
x_1<-c(1:12)
x_2<-c(1:12)
#expected value of the each dice roll dice 
mu_1<-mean(x_1) 
mu_2<-mean(x_2)
list(mu_1, mu_2)
```


#Question 2
The variable of interest is the failure rate of chips in our manufactoring process. Given that the probability of failure is 0.005, we would expect that less than one out of every 50 chips fail to meet specifications. 

I would advise that we enter into a contract with the firm. The probability of failing to meet their requirements is less than 0.005%. 
More to it, in order to make a better decision, we need information on the resulting penalty and profit margins for each chip. If we expect a few chips to be defective, we could send an extra box to ensure that they have 10,000 chips that work properly and could reduce the number of shipments that our firm sends their firm. 

```{r}
#Add in set.seed again just in case 
set.seed(123456)
#Failure as the probability that less than 2 chips fail 
Success<-dbinom(48, size=50, prob=.995)+dbinom(49, size=50, prob=.995)+dbinom(50, size=50, prob=.995)
#the probability that we will have more than 2 chips fail in a shipment 
Success 
1-Success
```


#Question 3 
I don't think our student's strategy worked out very well for him. The student should have studied more for his quiz. Given set.seed(123456), our student should only get one answer right out of the 20 questions.

```{r}
set.seed(123456)
#generate 20 observations 
observations_3<-runif(20)
#Binomial comparison 
sample_3<-sample(0:1, 20, replace = TRUE, prob=c(0.9,0.1))
sample_3
```


#Question 4 
```{r}
#again for safety 
set.seed(123456)
#create our function 
U<-runif(10000)
U_4<-1+2*U
gx<-U_4^2+U_4
mean(gx)
2*mean(gx)
```

#Question 5
```{r}
set.seed(123456)
mu_5<-vector(,10000)
for(i in 1:10000){
  sample_5<-sample(0:1, 10000, replace = TRUE)
mu_5[i] <- mean(sample_5)}
plot(density(mu_5))
```

#Question 6
```{r}
for (i in 1:5)
  print(i)
```
#Question 7
```{r}
for(n in 11:21)
for(i in 10:0){
  if(n-i>0)
    if(n-i<11)
  print (n-i)}
```
